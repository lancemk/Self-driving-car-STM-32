#Hardware Specifications for this project

##chassis 
1) HPI sprint 2 (why? its a good balance between price and quality). I would suggest the "All aluminium upgrade".
2) Ride height : 25 mm (you need it to be this high for the optical flow to work properly. For anyone worried about the high center of mass, dont be. The standard ride height of 10 mm is only acceptable when driving on a well paved surface, this car has to drive over normal parking lot surfaces in a country where the definition of a parking lot is "any area which isn't dirt" even though most parking lots here are in dirt. 
3) ESC and motor : you're free to chose any ESC and motor combination but I like to run a 120 A ESC (hobbywing) and a 3500 kv sensored motor. 
4) Spur and pinion : 31 teeth pinion and 80-81 teeth spur (48 pitch both). (this gets me a gearing ratio of about 1:5.5 
5) Drivetrain layout : RWD (this is to make space for the autopilot)
6) Suspension : standard HPI sprint 2 springs with 300cst silicon oil all around
7) Steering geometry : 1 degree TOE-IN.
