## Self-driving-car-STM-32

do not clone it yet! its a work in progress. Its an improved version of the self driving car. It runs on the stm32 bluepill (STM32F103C8T6) BUT it is not yet even in it's testing phase. I am still working on it.

## Building the project : 

(will update this as I build this project)

Apart from the libraries in the "libraries" folder, you will have to clone the following repository : https://github.com/naughtyStark/Arduino_STM32 and follow the instructions in this video for setting up your arduino IDE :
