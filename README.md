## Self-driving-car-STM-32

do not clone it yet! its a work in progress. Its an improved version of the self driving car. It runs on the stm32 bluepill (STM32F103C8T6) BUT it is not yet even in it's testing phase. I am still working on it.

## Building the project : 

(will update this as I build this project)

For the hardware specifications and 3d print files as well as 2 d drawings, go into the "hardware folder"

For the back end libraries, go into the "libraries folder".(surprise surprise).

You will have to clone the following repository : https://github.com/naughtyStark/Arduino_STM32 and follow the instructions in this video for setting up your arduino IDE :
